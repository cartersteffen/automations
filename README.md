# Auto Updater

This repository contains a small automation to check for updates for installed applications and plugins and apply them automatically.

Files added:

- `.github/workflows/auto-update.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow; triggered by a button (workflow_dispatch) and a daily cron at 00:00 UTC.
- `scripts/update_all.sh` - The updater script that reads `scripts/update-manifest.txt` and runs the appropriate update commands.
- `scripts/update-manifest.txt` - A sample manifest listing packages to update.

How it runs

- The workflow is intended to run on a self-hosted runner. The runner must have the label `auto-updater` so the workflow targets it.
- When executed, the workflow checks out the repo, makes the updater script executable, runs it using the manifest, and uploads a log artifact.

Setting up a self-hosted runner (high level)

1. On your machine (macOS, Linux, or Windows), follow GitHub's instructions to create a self-hosted runner for your repository or organization.
2. When configuring the runner, add the label `auto-updater` so the workflow picks it up.
3. Ensure the runner is running as a service or process so it can accept jobs.

Security and safety notes

- This script runs commands that update software on the machine. Run it only on machines you control and trust.
- The manifest supports a `custom:` type which will execute arbitrary shell commands. Be careful with entries here.
- The workflow is designed to run on a self-hosted runner for safety â€” it will not modify GitHub-hosted runners or other remote environments.

Extending the manifest

- You can add entries in `scripts/update-manifest.txt` using the supported prefixes:

  - `brew:` for Homebrew packages
  - `brew-cask:` for Homebrew casks
  - `mas:` for Mac App Store IDs (requires `mas` CLI)
  - `npm:` for global npm packages
  - `pip:` for Python packages (pip3 preferred)
  - `apt:`, `snap:`, `flatpak:` for Linux package managers
  - `custom:` to run any shell command

Running locally

Make the script executable:

```sh
chmod +x scripts/update_all.sh
```

Run:

```sh
./scripts/update_all.sh scripts/update-manifest.txt
```

Logs

- The workflow saves the update log as an artifact named `update-logs`.

Next steps and ideas

- Add email or Slack notifications on update success/failure.
- Add a dry-run mode to the script that shows what would change.
- Add per-entry version checks and only upgrade if a newer version exists.
